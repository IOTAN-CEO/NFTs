# NFTs
NFTs on OpenSea
Decentralized projects are the hallmark of IOTAN. It is expected that all verifications and listings will be completed by the middle of next year. There will be both digital and physical items available for purchase at Room 307 Records. A staking program is also available to you. For the first time, the coins are only available with the purchase of our NFTs. Besides listing coins on the market, you can also sell and trade them. Metaverses with festivals and schools are in the works. Moreover, we plant trees for the environment as part of a program. We have already started planting (you can check the live chart on the website). We are in the process of creating a roadmap and whitepaper. You will also be able to use your received NFTS in our metaverse. We look forward to the project and ask anyone who is afraid of losses not to invest in our project because we don't know what the future will bring. Your IOTAN studio team
